# Challenge 1

Write a function that will receive 3 parameters.
first parameters is a set of names ([]string),
second parameter is a set of integers,
third parameter is an integers.
The first and second parameter are paired, meaning the first name is paired with the first number, second name is paired
with second number, third name is paired with third number, and so on.
Find and return the names ([]string) that have bigger value than the third parameter.

Example:
input:
param1 = ["Surya", "Bobby", "Alfa", "Ilham", "Sena"]
param2 = [12, 98, 45, 76, 8]
param3 = 42

output: ["Bobby", "Alfa", "Ilham"]

Example 2:
input:
param1 = ["Surya", "Bobby", "Alfa", "Ilham", "Sena"]
param2 = [12, 24, 66, 54, 43]
param3 = 88

output = []
