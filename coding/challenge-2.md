# Challenge 2

Write a function that will receive a string as input. Find all the position of vowels in that string.

Example: 
input: "Hello world!"
output: [2, 5, 8]

note: 
1. The first character of the input will mark as first position,
2. If there's whitespaces before a word, it will be counted as character. (i.e " Hello" = [3, 6])
