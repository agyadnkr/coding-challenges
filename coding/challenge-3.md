#Challenge 3

Write a function that will receive 2 parameter.
first parameter is an array of random positive integer that can occur more than once,
second parameter is an integer (let's call it "n").
Find and return the position of the number that occurs exactly "n" times.

Example:
input:
params1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 2, 5, 6]
params2 = 3

output = [2, 8, 9]

Example 2:
input:
params1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
params2 = 1

output = [7]

note:
1. Params1 only consists of positive integer greater than 0,
2. Params2 is positive integer greater than 0.
